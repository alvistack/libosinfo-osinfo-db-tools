Virtualization tools, such as virtinst and virt-manager, need to track several
pieces of information related to the work they do, including metadata related
to operating systems, devices, hypervisors and more.

In the past, this metadata has been stored as a sizable python dict inside the
virtinst tool, which isn't a very elegant solution. Libosinfo aims to remedy
this, by providing the metadata independent of any existing virtualization
tools, and by providing an API to query the data.

The basic idea would be as follows:

1. All the data stored right now as a python dict is replaced with a collection
of files encoding the same data.
2. The data does *not* contain a fixed hierarchy. We do not segregate by
vendors on a top level, followed by operating system, followed by revision -
instead, we have a flat set of top level objects such as operating systems.
Each such object has a collection of properties, such as vendor, that would
allow an application using the API to impose any arbitrary sort of hierarchy 
on the data.
